At the beginning of 2022, I've made a decision to host my personal website
using GitHub Pages service and Gatsby, while also incorporating TypeScript
instead of vanilla JavaScript to get my feet wet into static typing used in webdev.

## Basic aspects

1. Why this instead of single-page portfolio?

I've decided to introduce the blogging aspect into my site as
a more "dramatic" section of my portfolio. I know this may be a far fetch,
but I think that posts that may show my gradual improvement in new IT topics
and how I approach these new technologies can also give some indication of
my working style/habits and persistence after each succesive failure.
So in short - they can show that a stubborn mind can force
through any difficulties if the ultimate goal is to learn cool
and interesting things.

Furthermore, I **cannot** count how many times somebody else
saved me during my professional and amateur work by
simply posting a solution to a very specific problem on their personal site.
I am a **fierce** believer into the idea that a real engineer
should **know his fair share** of stuff, but (sometimes even more) importantly -
should **know how and where to look** for information.
So availability of such information is **crucial** to me,
which means that by blogging I can contribute some nuggets
of knowledge that an engineer may need during desperate times.

1. Why Gatsby instead of GitHub Pages default i.e. Jekyll?

I was never properly introduced to Ruby, honestly.
**I have nothing against the language**. I may even try it to build
something with it in the future, but originally I've started
my front-end journey with React, so I am kind of immersed into the
JavaScript side of webdev things. That's why I've chosen React
as my FE framework and the go-to SSG that uses it under the hood
is Gatsby. In short, I am not anti-Jekyll
- I've just wanted a different stack to polish my React skills.

However, I think **Jekyll looks cool in applications like virtual gardens**,
which can be used as a quickly setup knowledge base for small developer teams
or to glue together a nice looking Wiki thingymajig.

Also, let's be honest. You can even manually write some cool,
marquee-filled HTML pages, plop them down into `gh-pages` branch,
botch some deploy script and call it a day.
The SSG used doesn't really matter - at least in the sense
of solely providing the content.

Since these aspects are covered in the official readme
of GitHub project where this site's code is kept,
please refer to that by using the button shown below
(btw you can also read what it does in the readme,
it's really cool, **trust me**).
