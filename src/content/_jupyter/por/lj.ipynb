    "This quick notebook lets you visualize the Lennard-Jones potential and force. The Lennard-Jones potential is a simple model for the interaction between two atoms or molecules. It is also often called the \"12-6 potential\" due to the powers of its two terms - the first term is a repulsive term that goes as $r^{-12}$, and the second term is an attractive term that goes as $r^{-6}$. The potential is given by:\n",

These are the parameters of the Lennard-Jones potential, that are two little knobs with which we can control the characteristics of interactions between our atoms. In other words, they are quantities dependent on the physical/chemical makeup of our system - just like the material was for our spring!\n",

But why? Well, in mathematics, if You want to gain some additional insight into the maximum or minimum of the function, You can try calculating its first **derivative** and figure out where it is equal to zero. This is exactly what we will do next - but in a dope way, using the `sympy` library to calculate the derivative symbolically and plot it using `matplotlib`."
