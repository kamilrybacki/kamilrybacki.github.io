In the middle of 2022 I was approached by a company
that provides deck and machinery service for ships.
They needed a website to present their offer
and to be able to communicate with their customers.
Moreover, they wanted to include current job offers
and information about their terms of service,
all in separate section of the website.

Thus, the website was to be a simple one-page website
that uses a single-page application (SPA) approach
implemented with [SolidJS](https://solidjs.com/) and its router.

Content is internationalized with [Rosetta](https://github.com/lukeed/rosetta) library
and stored in easily updated JSON files that are pulled once
during rendering of the page on the server side.

Users can switch between languages using a language select button
that is located in the top right corner of the page.
The website is also responsive and works well on mobile devices.

The overall design of the website was consulted with the client,
together with the choice of colors, fonts and the layout of the page.
Thus, the client was able to see the progress of the website
from the very beginning and to provide feedback neccessary
to make the website look and function as they wanted.
