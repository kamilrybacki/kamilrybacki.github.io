This project was my first attempt to create a GitHub Action,
namely an Action implemented using TypeScript language,
due to a (relative) ease of writing tests for it,
by incorporating Jest framework into the project's CI pipeline.

An idea for this project came to me
during my work on my other project
[Pile](https://github.com/KamilRybacki/Pile),
where I was using GitHub Actions to run
a set of checks on the codebase,
which were taking a considerable amount of time to complete.
due to them being run on the whole codebase,
even if only a small part of it was changed.

Moreover, a specific issue occured, when I have limited the checks
to be run only on the recently modified files i.e.
by running a regex on the list of files modified
in the commit provided by `git diff` command
and then passing the list of files to the specific checks e.g. linters.

This sped up the overall pipeline, but resulted in a situation,
where some of the files got left unchecked
after an unsuccessful Workflow run.
For example, this issue occured when I have
pushed in quick succession two seprate commits
and each of them included modifications to
completely different parts of the codebase.

Let's say, one consisted of changes made in the Ansible playbook files,
while the other one included changes made in the utility Python scripts.

In such a case, the checks run for the first batch of files were stopped
and the whole pipeline got cancelled, due to the second batch
of files being pushed to the repository,
which triggered the second run of the checks.
However, during this second check
run, the checks for the first batch of files were not run,
as they were not modified in the second commit.

The final result of such mishap was that the checks for
the first batch of files were not run at all, but the second pipeline was successful.
So the "need for speed" resulted in a major loophole in the CI/CD pipeline,
which was not detected until the second commit was pushed.

How I've decided to approach this problem and incorporate caching
of the list containing to-be-checked files
using GitHub Secrets API can be found
in the project's README.
