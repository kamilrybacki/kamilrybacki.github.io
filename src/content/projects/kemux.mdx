Kemux is a powerful Python library designed to simplify efficient message routing from Kafka topics.
With Kemux, you can easily route messages from one topic to another based on a set of rules,
making it one of the tools that can be used for efficient data processing.

At its core, Kemux leverages Robinhood's Faust to process messages from one topic and
route them to another topic based on a predefined set of rules.

These rules are defined within a [`Stream` object], which specifies the input and output topics,
message schemas, and a range of filters and transformations to be applied to the messages.

By utilizing Kemux, you can streamline your data processing pipeline and ensure that messages are efficiently routed
to their intended destinations.

Whether you need to filter, transform, or aggregate data, Kemux provides a flexible and scalable solution.

**Rule-based Routing**: Kemux allows you to define rules that determine how messages should be routed.
  This enables you to easily handle complex routing scenarios and adapt to changing requirements.

**Seamless Integration with Kafka**: Kemux seamlessly integrates with Kafka,
a popular distributed streaming platform. This ensures that your message routing is performed efficiently and reliably.

**Extensible and Customizable**: Kemux is built on top of Robinhood's Faust,
which provides a powerful framework for building stream processing applications.
You can leverage Faust's extensive features to customize and extend Kemux according to your specific needs.

The documentation provides detailed instructions on installation, configuration,
and usage, along with examples to help you quickly integrate Kemux into your projects.
