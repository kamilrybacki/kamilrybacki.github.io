The PPEAgentDeployment playbook automates the deployment process, ensuring that the server is up and running quickly and efficiently,
allowing you to focus on developing your applications dependent on the energy consumption data.

The resulting server, known as the PPEAgent, is a Python ASGI server that fetches energy consumption data from the Energa MójLicznik service,
that is exposed to the end user as a RESTful API through TLS-secured connections via Kubernetes Service and Ingress resources.

Passing the authentication data to the PPEAgent Pod is done through Kubernetes Secrets, ensuring that sensitive information is securely stored and managed.
A user only needs to define (at minimum) the Namespace in which PPEAgent will run and define environment variables with the authentication data
on the host running the Ansible playbook.
