This project deploys a small Python ASGI server that exposes
a data-fetching API for energy consumption data scraped from
[Energa Operator M贸jLicznik service]. Due to the scale of the project,
I've chosen FastAPI since it provides a great performance and is easy to use.

The data scraping part is done in a way that minimizes the amount of fetched data
by avoiding naive scraping of the whole page. Instead, the server sends requests to
endpoints used by the Energa web application to fetch the data.

Authentication requires only data used normally while logging into the M贸jLicznik service,
without additional information about the meter or the user. The server stores the session
data in memory, so it is not persistent between server restarts and after the termination
of the agent service - the session is explicitly closed. The whole process is done
in a stateless manner to ensure the security of the user's data and to avoid any potential
leaks of sensitive information.

The server is run using Uvicorn, which is a lightning-fast ASGI server implementation.
The API has several endpoints that offer basic information about the chosen subpaths,
so it can be used simply by traversing from the root path.

The server can be run in a Docker container, which makes it
easy to deploy and manage. As for now, one meter per one access point is supported,
but after initial tests, I plan to extend the project to support multiple meters.
