The journey to ServeMyKind began with a simple need: to set up a test environment that mimics production,
where services are accessible via DNS-resolvable addresses.
I wanted to avoid the constant hassle of finding and remembering ports for each service.

That's when I found KinD (Kubernetes in Docker), an excellent tool for running local Kubernetes clusters.
But even with KinD, creating a smooth, production-like environment required too much manual setup.

It automates the entire process, making it easy to access services with friendly URLs, without port confusion.
This allows You to create a development setup that feels like your live environment,
while still being lightweight and easy to manage via Ansible, letting You handle all the configurations effortlessly 🛠️

With ServeMyKind, you can quickly set up a local Kubernetes cluster with:

- [Cilium](https://cilium.io/) for network security and observability 🛡
- [MetalLB](https://metallb.universe.tf/) for load balancing 🔄
- [Dnsmasq](http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/doc.html) for DNS resolution 📡
- [NGINX](https://www.nginx.com/) for ingress 🚪

Any services you deploy to the cluster will be accessible via DNS names, just like in a real production environment
e.g. `http://my-service.cluster.local`, where the domain (`cluster.local`) is configurable.
