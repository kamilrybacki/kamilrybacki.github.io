## Preamble

Throught the history, humanity has consistently managed to push the boundaries of what is possible,
with the constant rush of innovation and new ideas being the unstoppable force behind it,
impervious to the obstacles imposed by the laws of nature or other theories previously established by man.

Information technology was always no exception to this rule, having defied this confinement by simple logic.
One instance would be be the pronouncement of the death of Moore's law by Jensen Huang in 2022,
a law that was said to describe the exponential growth of our computational power. 

Another one would be the rise of the internet inseflt, which was said to be impossible by many, but yet here we are, 
connecting to other people via our phones, that are connecting to other phones via satellies wandering around the globe.
Definement of rules is one of the main reasons why we are able to push the boundaries of what is possible.

Another rule that is consistently broken by software developers is the rule of "If it ain't broke, don't fix it".
And so, during this warm month of September 2023, I've decided to break my fully-functioning personal blog
and migrate it from Gatsby to Astro framework. 

I won't delve much into how I did it (i.e. how to init Astro project etc.), since I guess it has been presented
plenty of times by other webdev afficionados and documentation of Astro is top-notch.
More importantly. I will try to explain **why** I did it and what **did I gain** doing so.

The structure of this artivle will be dead simple. Each reason will be presented in a separate section
and supplemented (maybe) by a cool drawing.

### Disclaimer

I think that Gatsby is a great framework and I've learned a lot using it. I am not saying that it is bad,
I am just saying that Astro is better for me and my use case. It seems to be a more specialized tool,
that is more focused on the developer experience and simplicity of use, rather than the flexibility
to fit a wide range of use cases. **Please, don't take this article as a Gatsby hate speech.**
I respect it and I am grateful for the knowledge I've gained using it.

So...

## Profit #1: Simpler file-based routing

The first reason why I decided to migrate my blog to Astro was the file-based routing.
Taking a look at the previous version of my blog, you can see that I had to utilize
Gatsby's GraphQL API to query all the markdown files and then generate the pages
via `createPage` method, while keeping the structure of the blog posts in the `frontmatter` of each markdown file.

This generated for me a bit of overhead, since I had to keep the structure of the blog posts in two places,
which was a bit of a pain to maintain. For example, creation of project pages looked a little bit like this:

```js
const projectsResult = await graphql(`
  {
      allMdx(
          sort: {fields: [frontmatter___date]}
          filter: {fileAbsolutePath: {regex: "/\/projects\//"}}
      ) {
          edges {
              node {
                  frontmatter {
                      date(formatString: "MM/DD/YYYY")
                      title
                      tags
                      thumbnail
                      gallery
                      techs
                      abstract
                      link
                      readme
                  }
                  slug
                  timeToRead
                  body
              }
          }
      }
  }`);

...

projectsResult.data.allMdx.edges.forEach(({node}) => {
  const path = `/projects/${node.slug}`;

  createPage({
    path,
    component: require.resolve('./src/layouts/projects/layout.tsx'),
    context: {
      pagePath: path,
      frontmatter: {
        title: node.frontmatter.title,
        date: node.frontmatter.date,
        tags: node.frontmatter.tags.split(' ') || [],
        thumbnail: node.frontmatter.thumbnail,
        gallery: node.frontmatter.gallery,
        techs: node.frontmatter.techs.split(' ') ?? [],
        abstract: node.frontmatter.abstract,
        link: node.frontmatter.link || '',
        readme: node.frontmatter.readme || '',
      },
      content: node.body,
    }});
});
```

As you can see, **I** had to explicitly query the Markdown files,
extract the data from them and then pass it to the `createPage` method.

Also, note the `.js` extension of the file, which means that I had to use
plain JavaScript to do all of this, which is not a big deal, but I would
prefer to use TypeScript instead and have the type safety, but after some
pain with properly typing the GraphQL queries, I decided to give up on that.

So, GraphQL, maintaining the structure of the blog posts in two places
and keeping a series of config files had a bit of steep learning curve.

On the other hand, Astro's file-based routing is a breeze to use.
Just plop down the `.md. or `.mdx` file in the `src/content` directory and you're done.
Later You can just use the `.glob` syntax to query all the markdown files and
render appropriate routing components for them.

```astro
---
const posts = await Astro.glob('@content/*.md')  // query all the markdown files
---
<div>
  ... // render the posts
</div>
```

There is no chance to mess up the destructuring of the frontmatter data
or writing a buggy GraphQL query, because there is none of that here.
If you want a strongly typed data, you can group Your content into collections
and define their frontmatter structure using Zod schemas (through the `z` object).

```ts

import { defineCollection, z } from "astro:content";

const whateverCollection = defineCollection({
    type: "content",
    schema: z.object({
        title: z.string(),
        date: z.string(),
    }),
});

... // other collections

export const collections = {
    newCollectionName: whateverCollection,
    ...
};
```

But what with the routing? Well, Astro will automatically generate the routes
based on the tree structure of `src/pages` directory. For fully static pages,
just define `.astro` files that correspond to the routes You want to generate.

For dynamically generated pages e.g. blog posts, just define the `[...slug].astro` file
in the `src/pages/[subpath]` directory. Inside this file, export the `getStaticPaths` function
for astro to automatically generate the routes for You.

```astro
---
import { getCollection } from 'astro:content';  // eslint-disable-line import/no-unresolved

export async function getStaticPaths() {
  const newCollectionEntries = await getCollection('newCollectionName');
  return newCollectionEntries.map((entry: any) => ({
    params: { slug: entry.slug }, props: { entry },
  }));
}

const { entry } = Astro.props;
const { Content } = await entry.render();
---
... // Do things with entry and Content objects
```

From now on, rendered entries will be available under the `[siteURL]/[subpath]/[postSlug]` route.

So, to sum up - Astro's file-based routing is a breeze to use and it's much simpler than Gatsby's GraphQL API.
I define the structure of my posts in one place, the autocompletion *works* in my IDE out of the box
and the routing is done by creating files mirroring by desired routes, even if the routes are dynamic.

## Profit #2: Server-side code alongside HTML markup

Astro components are **the bomb**. In one `.astro` file, You can define two crucial things:

1. Operatons done on the server-side (e.g. fetching data from the database)
2. HTML markup that will be rendered on the client-side

```astro
---
// server-side code
---
// HTML markup
```

Dead simple.

This is a huge advantage over Gatsby, where You had to define the server-side operations
in the `gatsby-node.js` file and then pass the data to the front end framework of Your choice.

But fetching data is asynchronous, so there is sure a lot of mental, `async/await` gymnastics, right?
No. You just `await` those operations. The asynchronicity of code defined 
in the server-side section is (rightfully so) implicit.

```astro
---
const coolData = await fetch('https://coolapi.com/coolData').then(res => res.json());
---
... // use coolData in the HTML markup
```

I guess there is no need to explain why this is convenient.

## Profit #3: Component scoped styling and logic

Continuing the topic of magical `.astro` nuggets of happiness, 
let's talk about component scoped styling and logic.

So, when it comes to writing code, I tend to favour consistency,
even when it means doing seemingly unnecessary things.

That's actually how I've structured my blog's codebase when using Gatsby
or other React-like project ever since I've started my front-end shinangans.

Inside `component/` folder there was:

1. `component.tsx` - the component's logic
2. `style.ts` - the component's styling done via `styled-components` library (hence the `.ts` extension)
3. `style.css` - the component's styling done via plain CSS
4. `index.ts` - the component's entry point, where I've exported the component's logic and styling

So, by doing this weird ritual, I know that inside one folder bearing the component's name
I will find three, little files, each with a specific purpose. Here, separation of concerns was the name of the game here, 
with a hidden bonus of being able to write `import { Component } from '@components/component'`
instead of `import { Component } from '@components/component/component'`.

But this approach had one major flaw - it was a bit of a pain to maintain (and kind of over the top).
Also, consider for a second a library like TailwindCSS. It's great, I love it. And no, I won't say anything bad about it right now,
there is no trick to this statement. **BUT**, imagine a situation when I had to style a very simple element.
One word span. How to do it? 

Inline in the `component.tsx` file? Sure, why not.

Inside `style.ts`, exporting it from there? Sure, why not.

Inside `style.css`? Sure, why not.

Three options. Curse of abundance.
In case of one component I may decide to do it one way, in case of another component, one week later, I decide to do it another way.

This leads to messy codebase and leads to me breaking my own consistency rule. Sounds weird, I know, but
believe it or not, software engineering is centered about us humans pushing around magic, electric fairies
through sheets of heavily processed sand by use of esoteric phrases such as `for` and `do while`.
It is abstract by nature, so a little human error here and there is inevitable.

How Astro can help me with that? Well, it's simple. It's all in one file. The `.astro` file.

```astro
---
... // You know the drill
---
<style>
  ... // component's styling SCOPED ONLY TO THIS COMPONENT
</style>

<script>
  ... // component's logic
</script>
```

So, the component's logic and styling are in one place, which is great. I win a battle with myself one more time.
Thanks Astro.

What if I want to separate the styling from the logic? Well, I can do that too.
Just define the component's styling in the stylesheet file and import it in the component's script section.
(**not** the `<script>` tag, but the section with the dashes). I can keep this file in some other directory
in my codebase, so it is still separated and doesn't clutter mt `components/` section. This is also true
for any kind of animations or other CSS-related things that I may share between components
(for an example of that see the [`glitch.css`] file in my blog's codebase).

[Everything in its right place].

## Profit #4: Retaining extendability

What makes `.mdx` files so great? Well, the fact that they are just Markdown files,
but they also possess the ability to be extended with React components.

So, by simplifying other aspects of maintaining my blog, I can focus on providing
more visual and interactive content, which I plan to do **in the near future**.

This aspect is also connected in the way in which I can structure my frontend codebase
around different frameworks. For example, I can use Svelte for the interactive components
and React for the static ones. Astro lets You do that through its integrations,
that require You to run one `npm install` command and You are set.

I would love to delve into topics connected with data flow and processing on my blog,
since it is a topic that I am very interested in and what I do every day,
alongside my other, DevOps-ey duties. How cool would be to visualize the data
I am speaking about using `Chart.js` or other library? Or maybe present it in
a neat looking table? How about a possible integration with Python code
through `pyscript`?

By unloading the burden of complicated tooling, I can think about
**extending** the experience I want to create, not simply **keep everything together**,
afraid that if I modify one part of GraphQL query, the whole thing will break.

## Summary

I hope that this short list of reasons will show You why I have decided to take a leap
of faith and migrate my blog to Astro. I love getting to know new tools and frameworks,
so I am very excited to see what Astro will bring to the table in the future of my blog.
