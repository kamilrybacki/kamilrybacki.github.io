Photography has become more than just a hobby for me - it's a way to see the world differently.

## Getting Started

My first camera was a simple point-and-shoot, but it opened up a whole new world.

## Street Photography

Capturing candid moments in urban environments.

## Landscape Adventures

Exploring nature through the lens of a camera.
