## Lazy by nature ü¶•

There is a commonly known rule of energy conservation in the universe, that requires little to no introduction here.
We often try to distance the image of human nature from dependence on external rules governing our world,
defending it from the whims of subconscious instincts using notions of self-determination and free will.
The thing is - some of our mental building blocks are made of those simple mechanisms, programmed eons ago
to ensure that we carry on perfecting our civilization, autopiloting our survival through the everyday grind.
And just as those single-cell organisms, we conserve as much energy as possible, whenever we can i.e. **we are lazy
by default** *(speaking from the point of view of efficiency in managing our resources)* **and that is a good thing**.

Accepting this fact, we should cherish this trait of ours and use it to our advantage, whenever we can and whenever
it does not hurt our ambitions too much (or at all). **And** that is my justification for finding ways of not leaving
the VSCode window if there is a way to migrate some of the tasks I do to the editor itself. ü§∑

Lately, after the first adventures with my [Rust particle simulator],
I've been polishing up my Rust skill by doing LeetCode problems, starting from the easy ones and slowly climbing
up its algorithmic ladder. Normally, I would use the LeetCode website to do that, but there are couple of things that
bother me about it:

1. I start to miss my extensions such as CodeLens, GitLens, etc.
2. I like to use code-formatting tools such as `cargo fmt` and `rustfmt` to keep my code clean and tidy, and
   to familiarize myself with the Rust style guide over time.
3. In the future, I would like to be able to keep different implementations of the same problem in one place, so I can
   easily compare them and see how my skills have improved over time or do the same routing but in different languages.
4. I can't control the layout of windows and tabs in the LeetCode webapp, which is sometimes helpful when I want to
   have a reference to the problem description, my notes on the side or maybe methods I've used in past problems
   related to the language itself.
5. I want a setup that at first glance shows me my progress, without having to open the browser and log in to the
   website. Also - I want to be able to check it out offline and be redundant to the LeetCode website (in case it
    goes down or something).

So, I want to minimize the amount of context switching between the LeetCode website and my editor, because it is
distracting and it breaks my flow. **I want to be able to do everything in one place.** Because going back and forth
between the browser and the editor is a waste of time and energy, both of which I want to conserve. üîå

## Chinese doodads to the rescue üá®üá≥

There is a very popular [extension in VSCode marketplace called simply LeetCode] which tries to streamline the process
of solving LeetCode problems in the editor, made by (from what I understood after a squick Google investigation)
Chinese branch of LeetCode. Even though it is in alpha stage, it is quite usable and it has some nice features, such as:

- **Problem list** - a list of all problems available on LeetCode, with a search bar and a filter by difficulty.
- **Problem description** - a window with a problem description, which can be opened in a separate tab.
- **UI enchancements** - a couple of buttons that allow you to submit your solution, run tests, etc.

<CaptionedImage

  alt="A very nice extension with a **very** important disclaimer (excuse my Polish in the screenshot üòÖ)"
  height="400"
/>

However, it has one problem right now, that makes it slightly harder to login to the LeetCode website, because it
rejects third party authentication methods (such as Google or GitHub). Also, the login via LeetCode credentials
using VSCode UI is not working for me, so there is **one final option** left - using the browser to login and
then copy-pasting the session cookie to the extension dialog box. üç™

This can be done by opening the extension menu on the left side of the VSCode window and clicking on the
"Sign In" button, which will open a submenu with a "Sign In with Cookie" option. After clicking on it, a dialog
box will appear, asking for a session cookie.

<CaptionedImage
  src="/assets/images/leetcode_login.png"
  alt="Step-by-step login process (You can even see this article in the background! ü§Ø)"
  height="400"
/>

To get it, you need to open the LeetCode website in your browser and use the developer tools available in it,
which can be usually opened by pressing `F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I` (on Windows). Then, you need to go to the
tab that shows requests being made by Your browser whenever You reload any of the LeetCode pages. In my case,
I am using Google Chrome which has a `Network` tab in its DevTools, where I can access this information.

<CaptionedImage
  src="/assets/images/leetcode_network.png"
  alt="A list of HTTP requests made by the browser, visible in Google Chrome DevTools"
  height="300"
/>

The list presented above shows a snippet of requests made by the browser, but we are interested in the ones that are
named `graphql`, since they are the ones that contain information about our credentials being passed around the 
LeetCode site after logging in. More importantly, we are interested in **the first entry** which is named like this -
the other ones are not important to us. After clicking on it, we can see the details of the request, including
its headers. We are looking for a header named `Cookie`, which should be present under the `Request Headers` section. 

<CaptionedImage
  src="/assets/images/leetcode_cookie.png"
  alt="LeetCode session cookie, visible in Google Chrome DevTools"
  height="200"
/>

The value of this header is our session cookie, which we can copy and paste into the VSCode extension dialog box.
After that, we should be able to view our progress and solve problems in the editor, without having to leave it. üéâ
However, there is a catch. We will be able to click on problems, view their descriptions and open them in separate
windows using the `Code Now` button, but Rust syntax analyzer **won't** recognize the code as a valid Rust code,
because it is not a part of a Cargo project. üò¢

  alt="As You can see, no autocomplete shows up, even though Rust should know it its an `Option` variable"
  height="700"
/>

So we've got our environment set up, but we are still missing some of the features that we would normally have
in a Cargo project. To fix that, we need to dress up out LeetCode problems codebase as a sudo-Cargo project,
where each problem is a separate **public module** and the main file is a **binary** that imports those modules.
There is of course no need to compile this mystical binary, since we are only interested in the syntax analyzer
and the autocomplete features. üßô

My LeetCode problems are stored in a directory called `.leetcode` in my home directory, which is a Cargo project
named also `leetcode` (yeah, don't expect any creativity from me when it comes to naming things in this case,
all of this is just for Cargo to be happy). Inside it, there is a `src` directory, which contains a `main.rs` -
our umbrella entrypoint for `rust-analyzer` to be able to analyze code located in other files. üìÅ
Everything looks like this:

<FileTree
  root=".leetcode"
  tree={[
    "Cargo.toml",
    "Cargo.lock",
    {
      "src": [
        "main.rs",
        {
          "easy": [
            "1.two-sum.rs",
            "9.palindrome-number.rs",
            "..."
          ]
        }
      ]
    },
    "README.md"
  ]}
  annotations={``}
  links={``}
/>

As You can see, the source files for the actual problems are separated into additional directories, which are
named after the difficulty of the problem. This is just a personal preference, but I like to keep things tidy
and organized, so I can easily find what I am looking for. But why they are named according to this pattern:
`<problem-number>.<problem-name>.rs`? Well, this is how the LeetCode extension names the files when it downloads
them from the website. In other words, when You choose a problem from the extension menu called
"[21] Merge Two Sorted Lists", the extension will download the problem description and the code stub for it, and save it
in the pre-defined directory as `21.merge-two-sorted-lists.rs`. This generates from the get-go two additional questions
to answer:

1. What is this pre-defined directory and how it is related to our Cargo project workspace?
2. How will we import those files into our `main.rs`, since they do not meet the requirements of a valid Rust module name?

The answer to the first question is quite simple - the pre-defined directory is the one that we have specified in the
extension settings, which can be accessed by clicking on the gear icon in the extension menu. By default, it is set
to `~/.leetcode`, which is the same directory that we have used for our Cargo project. I have changed it to `~/.leetcode/src`,
but to be honest - You can leave it as it is since it will still be visible in the VSCode window containing the
open workspace. ü§∑

The second question is a bit more tricky, but it can be solved by using the `#[path = "..."]` attribute, which
allows us to specify the path to the file that we want to import. This is how the `main.rs` looks like:

<CodeSnippet
  code={`
    #[path = "easy/1.two-sum.rs"]
    pub mod problem_1;

    fn main() {
      println!("Hello, world!");
    }
  `}
  language="rust"
  filename="src/main.rs"
  annotations={`
    1: Path relative to main.rs file
    2: Module name (I choose to just use the problem number)
    5: It doesn't matter what we do here, since we are only interested in the syntax analyzer
  `}
/>

So the whole procedure is as follows:

1. We choose a problem from the extension menu.
2. The extension downloads the problem description and the code stub and saves it in the pre-defined directory.
3. I move the code stub to the appropriate directory, according to the problem difficulty e.g. `1.two-sum.rs` goes to `easy/1.two-sum.rs`.
4. I add a new module to the `main.rs` file, which imports the code stub using the `#[path = "..."]` attribute.
5. I enjoy the Rust syntax analyzer and autocomplete features, while solving the problem in the editor.

  alt="As You can see, the autocomplete works and the syntax analyzer is happy üéâ"
  height="700"
/>

This is how I've managed to make my LeetCode experience more comfortable and enjoyable, without having to leave
the editor. I am also managing a log of my progress as a simple Markdown table in the `README.md` file, where I
write down the problem metadata, my scores (speed and memory) and some helpful droplets of wisdom that I've learned
while solving the problem. üìù It can show You how these problems fall into certain classifications dictated by
the type of algorithms used to solve them like graph traversals or dynamic programming.

## Yeah, it really was a quick one, nothing left to see here ü§∑

I hope that this article will be helpful to someone, who is looking for a similar solution, as I have seen
some people asking about it on the Internet. If You have any questions or suggestions, feel free to contact me
via email or any other social media. üìß

The environment seen here is also available on my [GitHub as a repository] so You can check it out Yourself
and start cracking those weird algorithmic puzzles in Rust! ü¶Ä
