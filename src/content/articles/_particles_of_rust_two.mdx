## Keep it cool ‚ùÑÔ∏è

Right now, we have our first building blocks of molecular dynamics simulations ready - the definition of a bounding box
that encompasses our system and the definition of a particle. By providing the information about their relative positions
within a repeatable pattern (a unit cell of a crystal lattice) we can construct three-dimensional structures of any
crystalline material. Of course, if we want this structure can also be of any kind - even the completely random one,
since right now we are passing each particle's position manually in the simulation script.

So, the box and balls of our atomistic machine are up and running. Now, it's time to connect the spheres modeling
the atoms with "sticks", or in more scientific terms - with the **potential energy function**. Right now we will not
concern ourselves about implementing their behavior over time i.e. the dynamics of the system but rather focus on
the static picture of our simulation box.

By correct construction of the energetics of the interactions between the
particles, we will ensure that any mishaps we encounter during the integration of the equations of motion are not due to
the incorrect modeling of the potential energy landscape in the simulated lattice. **And believe me**, there is a plethora
of caveats that await us in the upcoming Newtonian puzzles, that are mostly related to the numerical precision of methods
we will choose. But, let's not get ahead of ourselves and focus on the task at hand.

This ignorance of dynamics is not uncommon and even has its own name - **molecular statics** (duh ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è). It is a
computationally less demanding approach to molecular dynamics simulations, where we are not interested in the
time evolution of the system but rather in the **equilibrium** state of the system. And as nature often has it,
this equilibrium is the situation where the forces acting on the particles are balanced and the system is at rest, so
**their overall energy is at minimum**. Funny enough, physicists identify such states as ones where, hypothetically,
the temperature of the system is absolute zero - as in, there is totally no movement of any particles, they are at 0 Kelvin.
So we're venturing into a very cold world, indeed. ü•∂

## First encounter with the moonspeak üåå

The potential energy function is a mathematical model that describes the interactions between particles in a system.
Speaking 100% technically, it is a function of the relative positions of two particles and it returns the potential
energy of interaction between them, expressed in the same units as any other type of energy (e.g. Joules). There
is a **multitude** of potential energy models, that have been established over the years. Some of them try to
expand upon the information required to correctly calculate interaction energy for a given pair of particles by
introducing additional parameters that are connected to, for example, the closest neighborhood of each particle
or the physical properties of the particles themselves (like their electronic structure). 

Here, for the sake of simplicity, we will stick to the most trivial potential energy model - the **Lennard-Jones potential**.
It is a model that describes the interaction between two neutral atoms or molecules. It is a sum of two terms - the first
one is a repulsive term, that is dominant at short distances and the second one is an attractive term, that is dominant
at long distances. This ensures that if particles start to get too close to each other, they will repel each other
to prevent their overlap and if they are too far away, they will attract each other to form a stable bond. So, in a way,
it is a model that describes the behavior of a pair of particles as if they were connected by a spring. You can
try right now to get a spring and squish it a bit, then release it and observe its behavior. It will, very shortly,
oscillate or do the ["boioioioing" thing], expanding and contracting until it reaches the equilibrium state - the state
where its dimensions come back to normal. I have found a very nice animation (courtesy of [physics-animations.com]), which
You can see below. The behaviour of those two bonded particles will be very similar to the explained behavior of the spring.
Of course, we neglect here that there are any other phenomena that may lead to this movement being damped like friction of
the air or the internal friction of the spring itself (You can imagine internal "layers" of the spring's material rubbing against
each other on the microscopic scale, wild, right? ü§Ø).

So we need that dual nature of the potential energy function to model the interactions between our particles and this will
translate into this oscillating motion when we integrate the equations of motion for our particles that will try to maintain
their state around some equilibrium. But You may be a little bit confused right now - I keep talking about potential **energy**
and **force** somewhat interchangeably. There is a simple explanation for that, that can be shown using simple, physical hieroglyphs.

### Unleashing the force üå™Ô∏è

Okay, so maybe You remember from Your high school physics classes that there is something as a **work**, in physical
sense, of course. It is a measure of the energy transfer that occurs when an object is moved over a distance by an
external force at a constant speed. This means, that over some **distance** (let's call it `d`) we apply some **force**
(let's call it `F`) and the object effectively gains some **energy** (let's call it `W`, as work). This relationship
can be briefly expressed as:

$$W = F \cdot d$$

A very graphical representation of this energy transfer would be a bullet that hits a wall. When the collision occurs, 
the bullet starts instantly to act with great force upon a fragment of the wall it hits, transferring its kinetic energy to the wall.
But this energy can also be thought of as a portion of work that the bullet has done on the wall, which forces the wall to adjust its position
by a distance calculated from the equation above: $$d = \frac{W}{F}$$.

However, we can also perform another transformation of this equation, to express the force acting on the object in terms of the work done on it:

$$F = \frac{W}{d}$$

which tells us that if we somehow measure or calculate the amount of work done between two objects separated by a distance `d`, we can
also calculate the force that was acting between them. But why? Well, we can imagine this force as trying to maintain the optimal distance
between those bodies, such that they will not be too close to each other (which would result in a repulsive force) or too far away from each other
(which would result in an attractive force). If they are not in this ideal state, each of them will have to perform some **work** to modify this
distance and its amount will be dependent on how far they are from this hypothetical **equilibrium**.

So, what if they are at this perfect distance from each other? Well, then the force acting between them will be zero, since they will not be trying to
change their relative position. Let's express this for our pair of objects as some perfect (equilibrium) distance $r_0$ for which: $F(r_0) = 0$ i.e. nothing happens.
**Any** deviation from this distance will result in a force acting between them, that will try to bring them back to this equilibrium.
We can write this deviation as a change in distance $\Delta r = r - r_0$ and the force acting between them as $F(\Delta r)$. Going back to our
equation for the force acting between them, we can express it as:

$$F(\Delta r) = -\frac{W(\Delta r)}{\Delta r}$$

where $W(\Delta r)$ is the work that would be needed to compensate for this sudden change and enforce back the equilibrium state.

Wait, why the minus? ü§î Well, remember what is the role of the force $F$. It tries to revert the current state of the system to the
original one, so it will be always antagonistic to the change that has occurred. So, the sign of $F$ must always be opposite to $\Delta r$
and that's why we have this minus sign in the equation above.

At this point, we must do a little switcheroo and say that this work will be some function dependent solely on the distance between particles.
In physics, a function that returns a numerical (scalar) value, which can be used to express the magnitude of some directional quantity
(like force, for example) is called a **potential**. In other words, this potential function will spit out a number that will tell us
how strong the interaction between particles is at a given distance **and** can be directly used to calculate the measure of this
interaction a.k.a force. We will denote this function as $U(\Delta r)$ and call it the **potential energy function**.

The last mental gymnastic we can perform is by saying that if $\Delta r$ can be expressed as a difference between a current
position of the object and some predefined constant (which is the equilibrium distance $r_0$) that will not change over time,
then the real dependence of potential function $U$ is on position $r$ directly. Same with the force acting between particles ($F$).
This may seem like we want to cheat a little bit and just substitute one thing for another, but mathematically speaking
the $r_0$ is a constant and the real argument of the function is $r$ - the equilibrium distance is not a dynamic measure.
Imagine back again a spring - its original, non-deformed length depends only on how it was manufactured and on the material
from which it is made. Similarly, our system also has its equilibrium state which can be derived from its composition
(like, which atoms constitute its makeup and what are their properties). So, our equation for the force acting between objects
can be expressed as:

$$F(r) = -\dfrac{U(r)}{\Delta r}$$

This is true for a significant change in the position, so for $\Delta r >> 1$ (much bigger than one unit of distance).
Now, let's go back to our cases of atoms connected by the aforementioned forces. We can imagine that any movement
measured at their scale will be super **miniscule** or even **infinitesimal** (infinitely small). This means that
our $\Delta r$ will be tending to zero, which allows us to use one of the magical tools of calculus - the derivative.
We can express the force acting between particles as. If we prefix very small amounts of quantities in our equation
with $d$ (like $dr$), we can express the force acting between particles as:

$$F(r) = -\dfrac{dU(r)}{dr}$$

Does that mean that we will have to measure those very small changes in distance? Well, no. The derivative allows us
to take the function that describes the potential between particles ($U(r)$) and then transform it using a set
of differentiation rules into a new function that will describe the force acting between particles ($F(r)$). This
is **huge** for us, because we will be able to calculate those forces **directly** via a mathematical function
implemented as a piece of code.

This sets up a first set of goals for us:

1. Find the mathematical expression for the Lennard-Jones potential energy function.
2. Quickly calculate its derivative to obtain the equation for the force acting between particles.
3. Implement a function that will take the distance between particles as an argument and return the force acting between them.
4. Do the calculation for all pairs of particles in our system and sum up the forces acting on each particle to obtain the net force acting on it.

Let's blitz through the mathematical part and then delve into more programming side of things.

## Slippery slopes of Lennard-Jones üèîÔ∏è

The Lennard-Jones potential is like a baby's first model to implement for the purposes of molecular dynamics simulations.
Finding an expression for it takes [literally one minute] and has a rather simple form with two rational terms:

$$U(r) = 4\varepsilon\left[\left(\dfrac{\sigma}{r}\right)^12-\left(\dfrac{\sigma}{r}\right)^6\right]$$

To get a better hand on its inner workings, let's investigate it using some good ol' Python and the `matplotlib` library.

import JupyterLiteEmbed from "@components/markdown/JupyterLiteEmbed"

<JupyterLiteEmbed
  size="500px"
  file="por/lj.ipynb"
  kernel="python"

/>

After our excursion, we got two major pieces of informations. The first one is the expression for the **force of interactions**
between particles derived from Lennard-Jones potential:

$$F(r) = 4 \epsilon \left(\frac{6 \sigma^{6}}{r^{7}} - \frac{12 \sigma^{12}}{r^{13}}\right)$$

that can be visualized using the graph generated at the end of the Jupyter Notebook ran previously:
