## A rolling stone

A portion of useful knowledge that finds the right pitcher along the way can often be forged into an action
that pushes new boundaries or, at least, helps keeping eveything in order by informed maintenance.

Sounds very pompous, but the main trick here is that good ideas become really, useful ones
only if they are shared effectively in an universal and understandable way. You need to sell them,
so other people can find new, exciting angles of utilizing them and keep the ball rolling.

Given that I like to ponder about hypothetical and abstract scenarios that I hope prove my points,
let's imagine the chaotic times of prehistoric cavemen, still polishing out novel concepts like
not getting totally obliterated by a mammoth or any notion of technology.

Suppose that one of them has found something rather interesting. When he picks up a very angular, edgy rock
and tries to roll it on the ground, it stops noticably faster than a round rock would. He fiddles with small pebbles,
medium-sized chunks and even some heavy chonkers, but the result is always the same. So, the shape is the key.
Round good, edgy bad - one of the first marvels of empirical research method is born and the gears begin to turn.
The caveman quickly smashes on rock with another to make it round and after some iterations he manages to
create humanity's first wheel.

Now, the question is - how does he share this knowledge with his fellow cavemen? He can't just tell them
about it, because they don't have a word for `wheel` yet - it has literally just been invented. So,
he decides to just roll it around and hope that they will notice. And they do. They see our caveman
with his new invention and they are intrigued. They want to know more. So, they ask him about it,
but he just points at the wheel and encourages them to try it out. They do and they are amazed.
Then, they take that wheel and duplicate it. After some time and more experimentation, they find out
that it is possible to attach it to a cart and use it to transport heavy objects.

By presenting one idea and letting other play around with it in a safe environment, a whole new
world of possibilities can be opened. And that's the main point of this article.
Ideas and knowledge must be spread around, experimented upon and "roll" freely in order to gain momentum and become useful.
Those that are delegated to shelves or boring PowerPoint presentations are doomed to be overgrown by moss. And that's
a shame, because they could have been used to build something great üòû.

## From cavemen to software engineers

So, what out rock-bashing friends have in common with people that dabble with code in 21st century?
Let's start with the fact that, well, they are human ü§∑. Their understanding can be supercharged by the same
mechanisms of messing around with, now more sophisticated, sticks and stones. A good presentation of even more
abstract concepts can make wonders and that is coming from a person that for two years sold the classic shtick
about electrical current being water flowing through pipes to elementary school kids. It works üë®‚Äçüè´. You don't even
have to sell the whole truth, just a good enough approximation that can be used to build upon.

There is no water in out outlets, electrons and protons don't "dislike" each other and the fact that there
is no strict typing in Python üêç doesn't speed up things in large or medium sized, entrprise(ish) projects.
But, those concepts are good enough to get the ball rolling i.e. hype up somebody about
a new idea by making them feel able to understand it. Fires up üèéÔ∏è their hunger for more [knowledge] üß†.

That is somewhat connected to the effect of "tutorial hell", where people constantly watch more and more
sketchy tutorials, but never actually build anything. They are stuck in a loop of consuming information
with no way of trying it out, even for a quick second. This leaves out one of the strong mechanisms of learning:
muscle memory through repetition. Getting it down through trying.

For example, if somebody actively progamms in C (or C++) üíÄ, they will start to,
seemingly automatically, put semicolons around their code without even thinking about it.
It's a reflex, a weird convolution built between the act of punching the semicolon key
and acknowledgement that a block of code (e.g. a line) has been finished.

I am not saying that broadening the theoretical knowledge is of no use, because there is a plethora
of fields of science where there is no experimentation at all and You just diddle around with exotics thoughts 24/7.
But, in the case of techical fields like software engineering, a couple of falls from the bike üö≤ must be made.
The trick is to create an isolated, safe environment where You can execute some awful, dirty JavaScript snippets.

Also, the second common ground with our saber-tooth dodging ancestors is that if You start to learn a new language
(or programming at all), You sometimes feel like a caveman in Plato's cave
that tries to come to the real truth by looking at its shadows - a common feeling when, for example, being hit by
a wall of new documentation. This goes away, You just keep rolling the wheel.
