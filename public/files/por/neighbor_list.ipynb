    "In this notebook I will briefly show the construction of the neighbor list for a 3D system. The neighbor list is a list of all the particles that are within a certain distance of a given particle. This is a very useful tool in molecular dynamics simulations, as it allows to calculate the forces between particles in a more efficient way.\n",
